# Keyword find from PDF
This Python script allows users to efficiently count occurrences of user-defined keywords across multiple PDF files in a directory. The results are output in a structured CSV format for easy analysis.

# How It Works:
1. Place the PDF files and the script (Keyword_finder_from_PDF.py) in the same directory.

2. Create an input_keywords.txt file in the same folder and list the keywords separated by commas.

3. Run the script file 'Keyword_finder_from_PDF.py'

4. The script processes each PDF and generates a keyword_dataset.csv file containing keyword counts, along with error details (if any).

# Features:
1. Analyzes keywords in searchable PDFs.

2. Supports case-insensitive keyword matching.

3. Provides clear output in CSV format, including PDF names, keyword counts, and error reasons.
